# PO - Project
Project of the Object-oriented Programming course @ IST - 2023/24

### Objective
Build a spreadsheet manager (like Excel) in Java.

### Notes
This project needs an external library (po-uilib) provided by our teacher to compile and run which I'm not going to provide here.
Both this library and the project description can be found in the PO [wiki](https://web.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~david.matos/w/pt/index.php/Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_com_Objectos/Projecto_de_Programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_com_Objectos).
